<h3>Botanical References:</h3>200, 266<br>
<h3>Nomenclature Notes:</h3><br>

<h3>Common Name:</h3>Aibika<br>


<h3>Range:</h3>E. Asia - South-eastern Asia to Northern Australia.<br>

<h3>Habitat:</h3>Wasteland and humid rocky hillsides[260]. In Nepal it grows at elevations of 700 - 1700 metres in rocky places with shrubs[272]. Grasslands, near streams and margins of farm land[266].<br>

<h3>General Information:</h3>Aibika is a shrub growing up to 5 metres tall.
The plant is often cultivated in the Tropics, especially in Asia and the Pacific Islands, both as an ornamental and for its edible leaves[200, 298, 300].<br>

<h3>Known Hazards:</h3>None known<br>

<h3>Cultivation Details:</h3>Easily grown in any well-drained soil in a sunny position[200]. Plants are most productive when grown in well-prepared fertile soils that are rich in organic matter[300].
Plants grow well in lowland tropical areas[300]. Yields begin to drop when plants are grown at elevations above 500 metres and plants may develop an annual habit of growth at higher elevations[300]. Plants have a high moisture requirement and grow best in areas with an evenly distributed annual precipitation of 1,000mm or more[300]. They prefer a relatively high humidity and a stable temperature above 25Â°c[300].
When well looked after, the plant can be highly productive - yields of 40 - 60 tonnes per hectare have been achieved[298, 300].
A very variable plant[300].
Plants do not flower well when day length is less than 12 hours[300].
Plants are somewhat susceptible to root nematodes[298].<br>

<h3>Edible Uses:</h3>Young leaves - raw or cooked[183, 200]. Sweet and mucilaginous[183, 300]. Young leaves can be used as a lettuce substitute[298]. Young shoots are harvested when about 15cm long[300].

Flower buds - raw or cooked[183].<br>

In Nepal the root juice is warmed and applied to sprains[272].

The juice of the flowers is used to treat chronic bronchitis and toothache[272].<br>

<h3>Medicinal:</h3>The bark is said to be emmenagogue[240]. A paste of the bark is used to treat wounds and cuts, with new paste being applied every 2 - 3 days for about 3 weeks[272].

<h3>Agroforestry Uses:</h3><br>

<h3>Uses Notes:</h3>None known<br>

<h3>Propagation:</h3>Seed - sow in situ. The seed should germinate with two weeks.
Cuttings of young shoots.<br>

<h3>Conservation Status:</h3><br>

<h3>Weed Potential:</h3>0<br>
